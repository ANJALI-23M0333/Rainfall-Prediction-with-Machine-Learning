# Rainfall-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

Developed and Evaluated Multiple Machine Learning Models for Rainfall Prediction:

Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Random Forest, LightGBM, Catboost, and XGBoost using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, Catboost, and XGBoost.
Achieved predictive accuracies of 78.96% (Logistic Regression), 85.95% (Decision Tree), 88.61% (Neural Network), 92.81% (Random Forest), 86.85% (LightGBM), 91.41% (Catboost), and 95.99% (XGBoost).
Utilized ROC AUC scores and Cohen's Kappa metrics to assess model performance, with ROC AUC ranging from 0.77 to 0.96 and Cohen's Kappa from 0.55 to 0.92.
Conducted Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering for Enhanced Model Performance:

Performed data preprocessing including missing value imputation using Iterative Imputer (MICE), outlier detection and removal via IQR, and categorical feature encoding with Label Encoding.
Applied resampling techniques to address class imbalance, resulting in a balanced dataset for improved model accuracy and stability.
Employed Min-Max Scaling and Feature Selection methods like Chi-Square and Random Forest to refine model input features, boosting predictive performance.
Visualized Model Performance and Decision Boundaries for Comprehensive Analysis:

Generated ROC curves, confusion matrices, and decision region plots to visualize and compare model performance across different classifiers.
Utilized libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and MLxtend for comprehensive data visualization, enabling effective communication of model accuracy, ROC AUC, and Cohen's Kappa scores.
Conducted comparative analysis through performance metrics and visualization to identify the most effective model for rainfall prediction.
